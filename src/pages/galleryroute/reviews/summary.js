                     or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure? On the other hand, 
                     we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, 
                     so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee.</p>
